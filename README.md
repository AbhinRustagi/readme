# Abhin Rustagi's README

> This is a guide on how to work with me, and how I operate. This document is inspired by READMEs of [Anand Chowdhary](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/readme) and [Tim Glaser](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser).

## Bio 

I have been coding quite actively since the age of 16. I developed my first Android Application at the age of 12 on a vacation to Melbourne, Australia. Amidst a lot of dilemma, I chose to be a software engineer in the middle of Undergraduate Hons. degree in Statistics. I have been born and brought in New Delhi, India. I'm always excited for the opportunity to work on new products which can potentially affect or change the way we humans conduct our lives. 

In my spare time, I experiment with a variety of coffee beans, plan or read up on Himalayan treks, or enjoy watching a game of cricket. 

## Quirks

- Weekends are supposed to be quite peaceful to me. I am, if required, open to working on Saturdays, but not on Sundays. 
- I don't like meetings which are scheduled at the last minute, without checking in or checking my availability, or ones which are scheduled post 7:30PM my time. I can still do early morning meetings.
